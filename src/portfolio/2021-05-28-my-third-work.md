This assignment was also given by professor Cynthia Teeters.

In this assignment, I have created a page that showcases a public domain poem along with an image.

Through this assignment:

I was able to understand and apply Semantic HTML, implement responsive web design principles.
Ensuring my HTML and CSS passes a validation check yet also practicing typographic and design best practices.
Continuously honoring the poem's structure, even on varying screen sizes - visually distinguishing line breaks and stanzas preserves the poem's meaning, enhances readability, and provides a better overall user experience.
