description: A simple but effective 3D card flipping site that shows CSS usage to create an animation effect!

This assignment was also given by professor Cynthia Teeters.

In this assignment, I have created a card that showcases an understanding of styling within CSS along with another type of 3d animation style whilst following alongside Kevin Powell's youtube video and changing various aspects to make the look of design into something that suits my taste more.
