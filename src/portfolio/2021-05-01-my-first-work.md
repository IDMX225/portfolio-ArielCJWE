In this assignment given to me by professor Cynthia Teeters:

I have learnt how to use Sass.
 I am using it mostly for file organization.
I've also learnt how to use Open Props through practicing styling BEM classes.
Also going on to practice making a poem page with animation styles within images.
I've also been practicing deploying my websites to Netlify.
